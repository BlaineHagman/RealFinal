        <img src="../images_and_videos/will_ferrin.webp" alt="Will Ferrin kicking the game-winning field goal" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
        <p>Will Ferrin is the PK (placekicker) for the BYU Cougars. Throughout the season, Will Ferrin had been one of the most reliable players BYU had obtained in the transfer portal. Prior to this game, Will Ferrin was 14-17 on his field goals with a 54 yard field goal being the longest. BYU was expected to win this game by a susbstantial margin. However, when the game started, that was clearly not the case. Utah scored 21 points in the second quarter of the game alone. With BYU being down at halftime 21-10, they knew they needed to do something to bring the game back within their grasp. After scoring 9 points, BYU was down by 2 points with 1 minute to go. BYU marched the ball down the field, giving Will Ferrin the chance to win the game for it. With the game, and season, on the line, Will Ferrin kicked the 44 yard field goal. As the ball went through the net, the fans in the University of Utah's stadium went silent. Will Ferrin secured BYU's victory with that game-winning field goal in the final moments, sealing a dramatic 22-21 win over Utah. "Big-game Bill" as his fellow teammates called him, cemented himself in BYU's legacy.</p>
